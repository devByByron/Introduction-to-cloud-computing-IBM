Containers are an executable unit of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in a consistent way so that it can run anywhere‚Äîon desktop, traditional IT, or the cloud.  

Unlike virtual machines, containers are **small, fast, and portable** because they do not require a guest OS for each instance. Instead, they leverage the features and resources of the host OS.

---

## Background

- Container technology has existed for a long time.  
- In 2008, the Linux kernel introduced **cgroups (control groups)**, paving the way for modern container technologies like:
  - **Docker**
  - **Kubernetes**
  - **Cloud Foundry**
  - **Rocket (rkt)**
  - Other runtimes

---

## Example: Deploying a Node.js Application

### Using Virtual Machines (VMs)
- VM setup requires:
  - Hardware  
  - Host Operating System  
  - Hypervisor  
  - Guest OS (for each VM)  
  - Binaries and libraries  

- Even for lightweight applications (e.g., Node.js), each VM must include a full guest OS and supporting libraries.  
- This leads to **resource bloat**:
  - Smallest Node.js VM ‚âà 400+ MB  
  - Actual Node.js runtime + app ‚âà <15 MB  
- Scaling means duplicating the guest OS and libraries for every VM.  
- Compatibility issues may arise between local development environments (e.g., macOS) and production VMs.

- Containers streamline deployment by following a **3-step process**:
  1. **Manifest** (e.g., Dockerfile, Cloud Foundry manifest)  
  2. **Image** (Docker image, Application Container Image, etc.)  
  3. **Container** (runnable instance with all required runtimes, libraries, and binaries)

- Instead of a hypervisor, containers use a **runtime engine** (e.g., Docker Engine).  
- Multiple containers share the same host OS, making them much more lightweight.  
- Scaling is efficient since containers don‚Äôt replicate the guest OS.  

---

## Advantages of Containers

- **Portability**: Runs anywhere (local, data center, cloud).  
- **Lightweight**: No need to duplicate OS overhead.  
- **Resource Efficiency**: Shared resources across containers.  
- **Scalability**: Easily spin up/down instances as needed.  
- **Cloud Native Ready**: Supports modular, microservices-based architectures.  
- **Agile & DevOps Friendly**: Fits seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines.  

---

## Example: Multi-Service Application
- Suppose a Node.js app needs to call a **Python service** (e.g., to access a third-party image recognition API).  
- With VMs:
  - Each service would likely require a separate VM.  
  - Scaling one service independently would be difficult.  
- With Containers:
  - Node.js app and Python service can run in separate containers.  
  - Scale each independently.  
  - Shared resources are efficiently distributed across containers.

# Cloud Storage

Cloud storage is where you save data files in the cloud. Some storage must be **attached to a compute node** before it can be accessed, while other types can be accessed **directly** over the public internet or via private network connections.  

Cloud providers **host, secure, manage, and maintain** cloud storage and its infrastructure to ensure data availability when you need it.  

You typically pay **per gigabyte provisioned**, and costs depend on speed:  
- Faster read/write speeds = Higher cost  
- Slower speeds = Lower cost  

---

## Main Types of Cloud Storage

### 1. Direct Attached Storage (Local Storage)
- **Definition**: Storage directly presented to a cloud-based server (within the same chassis or rack).  
- **Use Case**: Commonly used to store a server‚Äôs operating system.  
- **Pros**:
  - Very fast access  
- **Cons**:
  - **Ephemeral** ‚Äì storage disappears once the compute node is terminated  
  - Not shareable across nodes  
  - Less resilient (RAID helps, but weaker than other storage types)  

---

# File Storage

File Storage is a cloud storage service that, like **Direct Attached Storage**, must be attached to a compute node before it can be accessed. However, it offers **lower cost**, **higher resilience**, and requires **less disk management** compared to direct attached storage.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Attached as a disk** to compute nodes.  
- **Provision larger volumes** than direct attached storage.  
- **Remote storage appliances** host the physical disks, managed entirely by the service provider.  
  - Includes **encryption in transit** for data security.  
  - Appliances are **highly resilient** to hardware failure.  
- **Mounted via Ethernet** (dedicated to storage traffic).  
  - Often called **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**, **Network File Storage**, or **NFS**.  
- **Variable performance**:  
  - Ethernet networks can experience **bandwidth fluctuations** under load.  
  - Cloud providers design for high throughput, but **consistent speed is not guaranteed**.  

---

## Mounting & Sharing
- Can be **mounted on multiple compute nodes simultaneously**.  
- Appears as a normal disk/volume to the node.  
- Ideal when multiple nodes or users need **shared access to the same storage**.  

---

## Common Use Cases
- **Departmental file shares**  
- **Landing zones** for incoming files to be processed by applications  
- **File repositories** for web services  
- **Databases** (if cost is more important than performance)  

---

## Performance Considerations: IOPS
- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** measures how fast the disks themselves read/write data.  
- **Not the same as network speed**.  
- **Higher IOPS = faster performance**, but also **higher cost**.  
- Provisioning too low ‚Üí bottlenecks and slow applications.  
- Provisioning too high ‚Üí wasted cost.  

### Example
- File share mounted on **30 compute nodes**.  
- Application makes **60 read/write operations per minute**.  
- Average = **1 operation per second**.  
- This illustrates how **different applications require different IOPS** levels.  

---

## Summary
- **File Storage** is best for **shared access** and workloads that don‚Äôt need ultra-consistent speeds.  
- **Block Storage** (covered next) is better when **low latency and high, consistent performance** are required.  


---

# Block Storage

Block storage is a cloud storage option that breaks files into **blocks (chunks of data)**, with each block stored under a **unique address**. Like **Direct Attached Storage** and **File Storage**, block storage must be **attached to a compute node** before it can be used.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Mounted as volumes** to compute nodes.  
- Uses **dedicated high-speed fiber optic networks** (faster and more reliable than Ethernet).  
- **Highly resilient** ‚Äì cloud providers secure data with encryption **at rest** and **in transit**.  
- Normally **mounted to only one compute node at a time** (unlike File Storage, which can be shared across many).  
- Typically **higher cost** than File Storage (due to fiber networks).  
- Supports specifying **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** at provisioning time.  
  - Some providers let you adjust IOPS later to match changing workloads.  

---

## When to Use Block Storage
Block storage is best suited for workloads that demand **low latency** and **consistent high performance**, such as:
- Databases (transactional & relational)  
- Mail servers  
- Boot volumes for VMware or other virtualization platforms  
- Applications requiring **high IOPS** and redundancy  

---

## Block vs File Storage

| Feature                  | File Storage (NFS)                          | Block Storage                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Connection**           | Ethernet (network attached storage)         | High-speed fiber (storage area network) |
| **Latency & Speed**      | Variable, can be slower under heavy load    | Consistent low-latency, high throughput |
| **Node Attachment**      | Can be mounted to **many nodes** (80+)      | Mounted to **one node only**            |
| **Use Cases**            | Shared file systems, collaborative work, mixed structured/unstructured data | Databases, mail servers, VMware boot volumes |
| **Cost**                 | Lower                                       | Higher                                  |

---

## Summary
- **File Storage** ‚Üí Best for collaboration, shared file systems, or workloads where cost matters more than performance.  
- **Block Storage** ‚Üí Best for performance-critical workloads where **speed, low latency, and consistency** are required.  
 

üîë **Key Term**:  
- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** ‚Äì measures how fast data can be read/written.  
- **Persistence** ‚Äì determines whether storage remains after a compute node is terminated.  

  - **Persistent**: Data survives even if the compute node is deleted (but storage costs continue).  
  - **Ephemeral**: Storage is deleted with the compute node (no costs, but data is lost).  

üíæ **Backups**:  
- Snapshots can be taken to preserve storage state:  
  - Fast to create (store metadata only)  
  - Record only incremental changes after the first snapshot  
  - Restore entire volumes (not individual files)  

---

# Object Storage

**Object Storage** is a cloud storage option designed for storing large amounts of **unstructured data**. Unlike **File** or **Block Storage**, it is not attached to a compute node. Instead, you interact with it through an **API** for uploading, downloading, and managing data.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Not attached to compute nodes** ‚Üí accessed directly via an API.  
- **Extremely cost-effective** ‚Üí usually just a few US cents per GB per month (or less, depending on tier).  
- **Virtually infinite scalability** ‚Üí storage expands as you add data; no predefined size needed.  
- **Flat structure** ‚Üí no hierarchical folders. Data is stored in **buckets**, with each file as an **object**.  
- **Metadata-rich** ‚Üí each object includes information like object ID, timestamps, and attributes for easy access and management.  
- **Fully managed** by the cloud provider ‚Üí includes built-in **resilience**, **replication**, and **high availability** options.  

---

## Buckets & Objects
- **Buckets** are top-level containers (like folders).  
  - You can create multiple buckets.  
  - **Buckets cannot be nested** (no buckets inside buckets).  
- **Objects** are the actual data items (files, images, videos, etc.) stored in buckets.  
- Metadata is automatically added to objects, enabling applications to quickly locate and manage them.  

---

## Resilience & Availability Options
- **Single-zone buckets** ‚Üí data stored in one data center.  
  - Lower cost, good for compliance or location-specific needs.  
- **Regional buckets** ‚Üí data stored in multiple zones within a region.  
- **Multi-region buckets** ‚Üí data stored redundantly across multiple regions.  
  - Higher cost, but maximizes **availability** and **durability**.  

---

## Common Use Cases
Object storage is ideal for **static data** where high-speed read/write is not critical:  
- **Documents, images, audio, and video files**  
- **IoT-generated data**  
- **Application binaries**  
- **Virtual machine images**  
- **Backup and archival data**  
- **Logs and analytics data**  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not suitable for:**  
- Running operating systems  
- Databases  
- Any application with frequently changing file contents  

---

## Summary
- Accessed via API, not attached to compute nodes.  
- Low cost and scalable ‚Äúpay for what you use‚Äù model.  
- Stores **objects inside buckets** with **flat structure**.  
- Great for static, unstructured data of any size.  
- Different tiers available for **resilience**, **availability**, and **access frequency**.  


---

## Summary

| Storage Type      | Speed   | Cost    | Persistence | Typical Use Cases |
|-------------------|---------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Direct Attached   | Fast    | High    | Ephemeral   | OS storage       |
| File Storage (NFS)| Medium  | Lower   | Optional    | Shared files, simple data organization |
| Block Storage     | Fastest | Higher  | Optional    | Databases, apps requiring high IOPS |
| Object Storage    | Slow    | Lowest  | Persistent  | Backups, unstructured data, large files |

# Object Storage, Data Tiers, and APIs

## Storage Tiers
- **Standard Tier**:  
  - For frequently accessed objects.  
  - Highest per gigabyte cost.  

- **Vault/Archive Tier**:  
  - For infrequently accessed documents (once or twice a month).  
  - Lower storage cost.  

- **Cold Vault Tier**:  
  - For rarely accessed data (once or twice a year).  
  - Extremely low cost (fractions of a cent per GB/month).  
  - Retrieval can take hours since data may be stored offline.  

- **Automatic Archiving**:  
  - Objects can be moved to cheaper tiers based on access patterns.  
  - Uses object metadata to determine archiving rules.  

## Performance
- Object Storage does **not** have IOPS options.  
- Slower compared to **file or block storage**.  
- Data retrieval can take seconds to hours depending on the tier.  
- Not ideal for applications requiring fast access.  

## Pricing
- Charged **per GB of storage per month**.  
- Additional retrieval costs, especially for vault and cold tiers.  
- Still cheaper overall than file or block storage.  

## APIs
- Accessed through an **Application Programming Interface (API)**.  
- Most common: **S3 API** (from AWS), widely adopted across providers.  
- S3-compatible APIs allow cross-vendor compatibility.  
- RESTful (HTTP-based) API enables:  
  - Managing buckets.  
  - Uploading (PUT) and downloading (GET) objects.  

## Use Cases
- **Existing and new applications**.  
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery (BDR)**:  
  - Cloud object storage replaces off-site tape solutions.  
  - Faster restores and improved efficiency.  
- Supported by many modern backup packages.  

## Key Takeaways
- Different tiers balance cost vs. access frequency.  
- Storage is cheap, but retrieval may incur costs/delays.  
- Slower than file or block storage.  
- APIs (often S3-compatible) make it widely usable.  
- Effective for backups and disaster recovery.
