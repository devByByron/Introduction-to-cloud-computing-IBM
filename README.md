## üìñ NIST Definition of Cloud Computing  
> *Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or provider interaction.*

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Five Essential Characteristics of Cloud  

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**  
   - Access resources anytime, like a **24-hour ATM** or **vending machine**.  
   - Always available, except during outages or security breaches.  

2. **Broad Network Access**  
   - Resources accessible via the internet from desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, wearables, etc.  
   - **Public Cloud** ‚Üí requires internet.  
   - **Private Cloud** ‚Üí can work on intranet.  

3. **Resource Pooling**  
   - Shared **multi-tenant model** reduces costs.  
   - Resources dynamically assigned/reassigned without users needing to know their physical location.  

4. **Rapid Elasticity**  
   - Resources can scale **up/down** (vertical) or **out/in** (horizontal) as needed.  
   - Example: more resources during holiday sales, reduced afterward.  

5. **Measured Service**  
   - **Pay-as-you-go** (utility model, like electricity).  
   - Exceptions: Free services (e.g., Gmail, Facebook, trial versions of AWS/Azure/GCP).
